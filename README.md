dataset</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">In this repo there are 4 main Jupiter notebook files,  with the implementation of a vision transformer architecture  that use Bilstm2d instead of self attention.\n-1 is made by sequencer small (second seqBlock has 8 sequencers), and was trained over 10 and 5  classes</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">-1 is  made by small sequencer size  and was trained only over 2 classes\n-1 made by medium sequencer size (second sequencer block has 14 sequencers)and was trained over 5-10 classes\n-1 made by medium sequencer size (second sequencer block has 14 sequencers), was trained over 2 classes</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The latter file named VanillaSequencer is an experiment using the same architecture vit with Bilstm plain.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The results achieved are not very good, accuracy still low and fluctuating  even after 30 epochs of training.The accuracy  for medium and small size over 5 classes training was of 21-30%,while for the one trained over 2 classes was about 56%, that is very low, especially for a binary classification tasks.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">To Install—\nIt is very easy, as it’s said in requirements.txt the only package needed to run the code are\nPytorch , numpy, sklearn .\nIt is needed to download the cifar10 dataset in order to run the project\nAll the project was developed in python 3.8.5</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">P.s. more specific details about the architecture, the code and the issues are in the report file, and in the Jupiternotebooks as description to the code.</p>\n</article>","renderedFileInfo":null,"shortPath":null,"tabSize":8,"topBannersInfo":{"overridingGlobalFundingFile":false,"globalPreferredFundingPath":null,"repoOwner":"S-tella","repoName":"Sequencer2D","showInvalidCitationWarning":false,"citationHelpUrl":"https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-citation-files","showDependabotConfigurationBanner":false,"actionsOnboardingTip":null},"truncated":false,"viewable":true,"workflowRedirectUrl":null,"symbols":{"timedOut":false,"notAnalyzed":false,"symbols":[{"name":"
